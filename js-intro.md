# Intro to Javascript Assessments

Answer these questions, then follow the instructions to submit your first assessment!

#### 1. What is a function? Why would you use one?
A function is a set of instructions that generates useful new information.  The function itself is a way to expand the capability of computers to generate information by taking variables and transforming them into a new piece of information named "Function".  You would use a function for any purpose, including for example: to perform a mathematical equation, sort a list, pull data out of a list, perform a loop, generate results of a comparison, etc.   Functions are the building blocks of programs in JavaScript and allow a program to broken into smaller steps.  One type of function is a method.

#### 2. What is a method?
In JavaScript, a method is always a function, but a function is not always a method.  A method is a function which is a property of an object.   An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value.  A property's value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method.

#### 3. What are some examples of javascript string methods?
.length
.slice()
.charAt()
.match()
.replace()
.indexOf()
.repeat()

#### 4. Explain the difference between accessor and mutator methods. Why would you use one over the other?
An accessor allows you to get data while a mutator allows you to change data.  If you wanted to change data,  you would use a mutator.  If you want to pull out certain data you would use an accessor.

#### 5. Explain the differences between console.log() and return. Why would you use one over the other?
Return produces a value in the computer program but the user does not see the result that is retuned on the screen.  The value can be used in subsequent steps of the program - but that process is internal and not visible to the user.

#### 6. What is one thing we did in class this week that helped you learn the most?
I have only been in class on Thursday and Friday so I have limited information on all of the activities of the week.  However, I found the Friday morning lecture on objects to be very helpful.
